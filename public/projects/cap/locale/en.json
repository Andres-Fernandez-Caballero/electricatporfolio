    "description": "This project serves as the central hub for the Argentine Skating Federation, streamlining the management of clubs, skaters, and competitions nationwide. I developed a custom CRM that automates membership fees, registrations, and other key processes, integrating MercadoPago for fast and secure payments. The platform is designed to be user-friendly, allowing clubs to manage their data, register for events, and handle payments seamlessly. With a modern, responsive design, it ensures a smooth experience for all users."
